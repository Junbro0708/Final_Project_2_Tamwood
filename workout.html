                      <p>
                        Lie back on a bench holding a dumbbell in each hand just to the sides of your shoulders. Your palms should be facing towards your feet in the starting position, although if you have shoulder issues then switch to a neutral grip, where the palms face each other.

                      <h3>Bench Press (Barbell)</h3>
                      <p>
                        Lie flat on your back on a bench, and grip the bar with hands just wider than shoulder-width apart, so when you’re at the bottom of your move your hands are directly above your elbows. This allows for maximum force generation. Bring the bar slowly down to your chest as you breathe in. Push up as you breathe out, gripping the bar hard and watching a spot on the ceiling rather than the bar, so you can ensure it travels the same path every time.

                        Grab the parallel bars and jump up, straighten your arms. Lower your body by bending your arms while leaning forward. Dip down until your shoulders are below your elbows.
                        Lift your body up by straightening your arms. Lock your elbows at the top.

                      <h3>Lat pull down</h3>
                      <p>
                        Switch your grip on the bar so you’re holding it with your palms facing you and your hands shoulder-width apart. By changing to an underhand grip you recruit your biceps to help with the movement, which has the added benefit of taking some of the load off your lats if they are tiring towards the end of a back workout. Holding the bar with that underhand grip, pull it down to below chin height, keeping your chest up throughout. Pause at the bottom of the movement, then take the bar back up under control.

                      <h3>Barbell Rows</h3>
                      <p>
                        Most people tend not to consider their back very much until the day it lets them down and they’re forced to spend hours lying in agony on a wooden floor. There is a solution, however: placing greater emphasis on your back training. Step forward, the bent-over row. Even regular gym-goers will generally focus on more glamorous muscles and spurn the opportunity to address the stress and strain a deskbound lifestyle can place on your back. The problem? Your shoulders internally rotate, and this results in tight pecs and a stiff neck.

                      <h3>Cable Rows</h3>
                      <p>
                        The cable row is one of the best cable exercises around and very neatly demonstrates the edge this machine has over free weights, because throughout the row movement you work against the same level of resistance so the muscles enlisted by the exercise are worked evenly. Chief among these are your lats, but your rear delts and erector spinae are also targeted, along with your biceps and forearms.

                      <h3>Side Lateral Raise (Shoulder)</h3>
                      <p>
                        The side lateral raise is an effective shoulder-strengthening movement designed to isolate the lateral head of the deltoid muscle. Performed regularly, this can help you develop stronger, broader shoulders. All you need is a pair of light dumbbells and enough shoulder flexibility to abduct your arms (lifting the weights out and away from your body) until they form a "T" shape at your shoulders.

                      <h3>Bicep Curl</h3>
                      <p>
                        Start standing with a dumbbell in each hand. Your elbows should rest at your sides and your forearms should extend out in front of your body. Your knees should stay slightly bent and your belly button should draw into the spine. Bring the dumbbells all the way up to your shoulders by bending your elbows. Once at the top, hold for a second by squeezing the muscle. And reverse the curl slowly and repeat.

                      <h3>Tricep Curl</h3>
                      <p>
                        Triceps curls are a strength-training exercise designed to build strength, definition, and stamina in the triceps. Triceps curls use a range of motion similar to lying triceps extensions. The triceps curl is a single-arm exercise that allows you to train one arm at a time. To perform triceps curls, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, keeping your back straight. Lift a dumbbell over and behind your head. Squeeze the triceps muscle to slowly raise the dumbbell above your head and lower it back down to complete the range of motion.

                      <p>
                        Sit down on a leg press machine and place your legs on the platform in front of you. Your feet should be positioned approximately a foot to one and half feet apart. Lower the safety bars holding the platform in place. Press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended, without locking your knees. This is the starting position. As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle. Push with the heels of your feet and use your quadriceps to go back to the starting position. Exhale as you do so. Repeat for the number of reps in your set. Make sure that the safety pins are locked properly once you have finished.

                        Lie face down on the lying leg curls machine, stretching your legs out fully. The roller pad should rest just above the heels, a few inches over your calves. Grasp the support handles on each side of the machine. Exhale and flex your knees, pulling your ankles as close to your buttocks as possible. Keep your hips firmly on the bench, and hold briefly. Inhale as you return your feet to the starting position in a slow and controlled movement.

                        Place a chair behind you and begin standing facing away from the chair, with both feet planted on the floor hip-width apart. Inhale and engage your core. Looking straight ahead, bend at both the hips and knees, ensuring that your knees remain in line with your toes. Continue bending, driving your hips back and bending your knees until you are able to lightly sit on the chair behind you, ensuring that you maintain a proud chest and avoid hunching throughout the movement. Exhale as you push through your heels to mid foot and extend your hips and knee simultaneously to return to the starting position. You should feel the tension in your glutes, quads and hamstrings.

              Since joining Fitness Within one year ago, I have become stronger and I have lost 38lbs.  The workouts are always different, hard and fun!  The trainers will push you harder than though you could go. When I joined, I also signed up for their HYBRID program.   I liked knowing you have someone there if you have questions and who is also going to hold you accountable.
